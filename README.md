# Ravelin Machine Learning Test

Part 1:

The 2 files include a list of json profiles representing fictional customers from an ecommerce company and a short python script than can be run to create a larger dataset using the `customers.jsonl` as a template. 

* Run the script. An integer parameter can be used to specify the number of rows of data. 
* Use the generated historic (offline) dataset to help build part of a training dataset for a payments fraud prevention model. Each row in the dataset will be used as a row of training data. We'd like to build a feature that captures the number of transactions that have occurred in the past 24 hours using the email domain of the training row example. 

We're looking for...

* Readable and scaleable code
* Clear explanations of the analysis and conclusions
* Please don't spend more than 1-2 hours on this task. You may find that there are more aspects of the model/data than you can realistically investigate and that's fine. If that is the case, please just describe what your next steps might be if there were more time allocated to the task.
